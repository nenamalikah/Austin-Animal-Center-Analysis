# OVERVIEW <br>
For the period between October 01, 2013 and December 23, 2021, a total of 134,864 animals were accepted into the Austin Animal Center. The majority of animals admitted into the center were stray animals, animals surrounded by their owners, and public assists. Stray intakes had the highest daily average of intakes, with about 31 stray animals accepted a day. Stray animals were followed by Owner Surrenders (about 10 a day), Public Assists (about 3 a day), and Wildlife (about 2 a day). Animal intakes tended to spike during the summer, both before and during the pandemic. Stray, wildlife, abandoned, and feral intakes were among the youngest intakes, with an estimated average age of 2 years old. 

## PANDEMIC ANIMAL INTAKES <br>
The data set spans from October 1, 2013 to December 23, 2021. For the purpose of analysis, we have set the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to March 15, 2020. The pandemic day with the most intakes was June 15th, 2021, with 85 intakes. The pre-pandemic day with the most animal intakes was July 9th, 2014, with 140 animal intakes. Prior to the pandemic, animal intakes tended to spike between June and July. Intakes also had a downwards trend between the fall and winter, presumably due to the holiday season, winter vacations, and/or inclement weather. The pandemic followed the same general pattern.

Among stray intakes, the pre-pandemic day with the most intakes was May 4, 2019, with 98 total intakes. The pandemic day with the most intakes was June 1, 2021, with 56 intakes. Among owner surrenders, the pre-pandemic day with the most intakes was September 23, 2016, with 73 intakes. The pandemic day with the most intakes was August 26, 2021, with 39 intakes.
